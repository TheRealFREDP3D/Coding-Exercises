# This script takes input for the number of slices of pizza and the number of residents.
# It calculates and prints the number of leftover slices after dividing the number of slices by the number of residents.

n = input("Number of slices: ")
m = input("Number of residents: ")

# Calculate the remainder when the integer n is divided by the integer m.
# "modulus"
# The function int() converts the strings into integers.

left_over = int(n) % int(m)

print(f'leftover: {left_over}')
