# Coding Exercises

A good way to learn coding is to code.

Here are the outcomes from my coding experimentation, encompassing activities undertaken during coding courses, engagements in CTF and diverse Challenges.

## Why

I am a big fan of the "Learn in Public" principles. It put some pressure to share good and working stuff. By sharing the results of my work, it creates networking opportunities. It can inspire people to start their own learning projects. It is a good way to show potential employer your skills or at least you appetite to learn. And finally, self-learners like me should have a way to monitor their progress.

## Goals

- Make my work available.
- Build a personnal knowlege base.
- Publish good and bad experiences.
- Practice making good documentation.
- Create content for GitBook, Wiki, Pages, Medium articles, etc.

Obviously, I want to learn programming.
