# Coding Exercises

> "The best way to learn coding is by doing." 

This repository contains the outcomes of my coding journey, including projects from coding courses, CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges, and various other programming exercises.

## Motivation

I'm a strong believer in the 'Learn in Public' philosophy. Here's why I maintain this repository:

1. It encourages me to produce and share high-quality work.
2. It creates networking opportunities by showcasing my skills and projects.
3. It can inspire others to embark on their learning journeys.
4. It serves as a portfolio for potential employers, demonstrating my skills and commitment to continuous learning.
5. As a self-learner, it helps me track my progress and stay motivated.
6. It keeps me focused on completing current projects before moving on to new ones.
7. It simplifies file management and organization of my learning materials.

## Goals

- Create a comprehensive reference for personal use and notes.
- Develop publishable notebooks and documentation.
- Practice creating clear, effective documentation.
- Generate content for various platforms (GitBook, Wiki, GitHub Pages, Medium articles, etc.)
