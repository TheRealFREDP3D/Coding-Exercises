# Coding Exercises

> "The best way to learn coding is to code."

This repository contains the outcomes of my learning coding journey. Including projects from coding courses, CTF challenges, and various other programming exercises.

## Motivation

I'm a strong believer in the 'Learn in Public' philosophy. Here's why I maintain this repository:

1. It encourages me to make an extra effort before I share my work.
2. It creates networking opportunities by showcasing my new skills and related projects.
3. It can inspire others to embark on their learning journeys.
4. It serves as a portfolio for potential employers, demonstrating my skills and commitment to continuous learning.
5. As a self-learner, it helps me track my progress and stay motivated to learn more.
6. It keeps me focused on completing current projects before moving on to new ones.
7. It simplifies file management and organization of my learning materials.

## Goals

- Create a comprehensive reference for personal use and notes.
- Develop publishable notebooks and documentation.
- Practice creating clear, effective documentation.
- Generate content for various platforms (GitBook, Wiki, GitHub Pages, Medium articles, etc.)
- Improve my skills in communication using a new language (My native language is French)
