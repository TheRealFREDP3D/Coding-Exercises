## Why

I am a big fan of the "Learn in Public" principles.

It put some pressure to share quality work. 

Showing what I do can help creating networking opportunities. 

It can inspire people to start their own learning projects. 

It is a good way to show potential employer your skills or at least you appetite to learn new ones.

Self-learners like me should have a way to monitor their progress.

Keep me on track, finish things before moving to the next.

Simplify files management
