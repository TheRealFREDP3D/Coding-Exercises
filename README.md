> A good way to learn coding is to code.

## Why I Created this Repository

I am a big fan of the "Learn in Public" principles. It put some pressure to share good and working stuff. By sharing the results of my work, it creates networking opportunities. It can inspire people to start their own learning projects. It is a good way to show potential employer your skills or at least you appetite to learn. And finally, self-learners like me should have a way to monitor their progress.  

- Make my work available to anyone, from anywhere.
- Reference material and notes.
- Prepare a publishable notebook.
- Practice making good documentation.
- Create content for GitBook, Wiki, Pages, Medium articles, etc.
